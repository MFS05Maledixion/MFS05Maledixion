## Hi there 👋

- My name's Mwayi and I work at [@CRXD DYSTOPYR](#) An Indie Game Studio where I make [3D Games](https://youtube.com/c/crxd_dystopyr), and post updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mk_maledixion)
- Before all that, I was a (mostly JavaScript) Full-Stack Web Developer and Developer Advocate ( I'm Still available for work though )
- You can still find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub but I don't code as much as I would like 👾! Right now I'm focused on building my indie studio into a AAA Studio 😁👍🏿

## Projects
- [AIDAR (Artificial Intelligence-based Dietary Analysis and Recommendation) System] (private repo 🔑)
- [Ubongo App] (private repo 🔑)
- [Arcade Snake Game](https://github.com/MFS05Maledixion/snake-py)

## Notes
- I'll try my best to keep updating this account and make cool projects to help y'all.

### OVERALL, I LOVE THIS COMMUNITY 🫶🏿, KEEP COMMITING GEEKS 🧑🏿‍💻
