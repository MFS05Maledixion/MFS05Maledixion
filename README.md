## Hi there 👋
- My name's Mwayi and I am the Founder & CEO & Sole Lead Developer at [@CRXD DYSTOPYR](#) An Indie Game Studio where I make [3D Games](https://youtube.com/c/crxd_dystopyr), and post updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mk_maledixion)
- Before all that, I was a (mostly JavaScript) Full-Stack Web Developer and Developer Advocate ( I'm Still available for work though )
- You can still find some of my projects and contributions here on GitHub but I don't code as much as I would like 👾! Right now I'm focused on building my indie studio into a AAA Studio 😁👍🏿

## Projects
- [AIDAR (Artificial Intelligence-based Dietary Analysis and Recommendation) System] (private repo 🔑)
- [Ubongo App] (private repo 🔑)
- [Arcade Snake Game](https://github.com/MFS05Maledixion/snake-py)

## My values
:open_hands:  **Teamwork** makes everyone stronger <br/>

:key:  Good **communication** is essential <br/>

:hearts:  I'm eager to **learn** something new <br/>

## Notes
